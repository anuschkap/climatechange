In this datascripts I want to practice applying weights with the anesrake package
```{r}
#install.packages("anesrake")
library(anesrake)
library(haven)
library(readxl)

```

```{r}
# Load the datasets
load("/Users/anuschka/Documents/climatechange/climatechange/data/final_data/dpes2021sel.RData")
weights <- read_excel("/Users/anuschka/Documents/climatechange/climatechange/data/all_waves/weigh_data.xlsx")

```


```{r}
# The variables that I will use to weigh the data have to have the same coding as the original variables (in this case of the dpes datafile)
weights$sex <- weights$male / weights$total_pop




```
